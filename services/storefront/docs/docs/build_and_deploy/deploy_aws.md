# Deploy to AWS Amplify

This guide covers how to deploy Composable UI to AWS Amplify.

##  Prerequisites

- You'll need an AWS account, sign up here: https://aws.amazon.com/
- You'll need to fork the Composable UI github repository.
   - This is required since later on you'll be authorizing AWS Amplify access to your forked copy of Composable UI.

## Create a new AWS Amplify app
- Sign into your AWS console
- Go to the  AWS Amplify service. It can be found by searching for "AWS Amplify" in the search bar.
- Once in the AWS Amplify dashboard, click on `Create new app`. Follow the steps below to configure the new app.

### Configure the new app

#### Source Code setup
- Select `GitHub` as the Git provider, and click `Next`.
- Select your Composable UI repository from the `Select a repository` search bar.
   - Note: You may need to click on the `Update GitHub permissions` button to authorize AWS access to your desired github organization and specific github repository.
- In `Select a branch`, select `main`.
- Select the `My app is a monorepo` checkbox. 
- Set the `Monorepo root directory` to `composable-ui`.
- Click `Next`

#### App settings

On the `App settings` screen:
- Set the desired `App name` for your Composable UI deployment. 
- The build settings are automatically detected from the `amplify.yml` file.
- The Environment Variables are configured in the `Advanced Settings` section. We will skip this for now, and come back to this in a later step.
- Click `Next`.


:::note
The Composable UI repository contains an `amplify.yml` file, which provides AWS Amplify with the necessary build configuration to successfully build and deploy Composable UI. Refer to [Understanding the build specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/yml-specification-syntax.html) to learn more about configuring the build.
:::

#### Review
On the `Review` screen, click `Save and deploy`.

The deployment will succeed, however, we now need to setup the [Environment Variables](#configure-environment-variables).


### Configure Environment Variables

We need to obtain the domain that the app is being deployed on: 
- Go to the main dashboard of your app in AWS Amplify.
- Click on `Hosting` => `Custom domains` and copy the URL to your clipboard. See the screenshot below for an example.

Now go to `Hosting` => `Environment variables`. We need to configure two environment variables for NextAuth.js:
- Create environment variable `NEXTAUTH_URL` and paste in the value we copied earlier from the Custom domains screen.
- Create environment variable `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`. This value is used by NextAuth.js to encrypt auth cookies. See the[ NextAuth.js docs](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_secret) for creating a strong secret. You can also set this to something like "changeme" and revisit this later on, prior to launching to production.

### Redeploy

After setting the `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variables, the app is now ready to be redeployed:
- Go to the  dashboard of your app, and click on the `main` deployment.
- Click the `Redeploy this version` button.
   - Note: If a build is currently running from the inital deployment, cancel the build, and then click `Redploy this version`

When the app finishes deployment, your Composable UI storefront is ready to use! Go back to the dashboard of your app, and click `Visit Deployed URL`.
